        What are Squats?
      </h3>
      <p>
      The squat is a compound movement. This means that the exercise is recruiting the usage of multiple muscle groups. It includes the quads, glutes and hamstrings. The main usage, however, is at the quads, as it is considered a quad dominated movement. A lot of the bending is done at the knees. This is an indicator of what muscles are carrying the most weight. Thus compared to a deadlift, where the main bend at the hips, a deadlift will mainly work the hamstrings and glutes.

        How to Do the Squat?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Try to lift only the bar first to be able to perfect your form <br>
        The bar should rest on your back and directly on the back of your shoulders <br>
        For a regular squat, have your feet shoulder width apart and toes slightly pointed out <br>
        If attempting to activate glutes, have a wider stance and play with the foot flare to see what targets your glue the most <br>
        Proceed by having a neutral spine, bend at the hips and knees, make sure that when bending your knees are pointing out

      <p>
      The deadlift is a compound movement. This means that the exercise is recruiting the usage of multiple muscle groups. It includes the quads, glutes and hamstrings, lats, and abs. The main usage, however, is at the glutes and hamstrings, as it is considered a hip dominated movement. A lot of the bending is done at the hips.
